	<main>
		<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website!</p>
		<p>My name is <strong>Willem Garnier</strong>, and I'm a software developer currently based in Cambridge, UK.</p>
		<p>
			I'll be honest - this website is currently mainly intended for potential employers.
			I don't currently keep a blog, sell my services free-lance, nor offer courses or merch.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead, it mainly serves to let me build and share <a href="/resume">my resume</a> using web technologies, which is a bit more enjoyable than the classic alternatives.
			Have a look, and don't hesitate to get in contact if you think I might be a good fit for your team!
			I'm always open to new opportunities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of software development, I currently spend most of my free time playing and training for <a href="https://youtu.be/DVVkfPoGVbw">Ultimate Frisbee</a>.
			I've competed at the European Championships a few times, and the sport has become a very important aspect of my life since first picking it up at university.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, I also share a lot of the "classic" software developer hobbies - if I'm not playing Ultimate you might often find me at a climbing wall, playing board games, or cooking.
			I also enjoy road cycling and hiking... and am always up for trying something new!
		</p>
		<p>
			That's me in a nutshell.
			If you want to chat, please feel free to <a href="mailto:willem.garnier@gmail.com">contact me</a> anytime!
		</p>
		<p>Have a great day!</p>

	<main>
		<p>
			I unfortunately haven't <strong>yet</strong> taken the time to make any of my side-projects public, or build a portfolio out of them.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're interested in seeing how I program, your best bet is to check out <a href="https://github.com/brooswajne">my GitHub profile</a>.
			Please keep in mind that a lot of the work on there is quite old and abandoned, and might not reflect how I <i>currently</i> approach building software.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, I tend to value spending my free time on some of my other hobbies outside of software development.
			As a result, the work I'm most proud of is often built for my employers, and I therefore can't share it publicly.
			I'd love to tell you (what I can) about it, though!
